Optimize the website content for search engine visibility by:

1. Adding relevant meta title and description tags
2. Including semantic HTML5 elements and proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
3. Implementing schema markup appropriate for the content type
4. Creating keyword-rich but natural content focused on the primary topic
5. Ensuring all images have descriptive alt text
6. Using SEO-friendly URLs with clear, descriptive slugs
7. Including internal links to related content
8. Optimizing page load speed and mobile responsiveness
9. Creating an XML sitemap and robots.txt file
10. Ensuring proper canonical tags are in place

Target keywords should align with user search intent and maintain a natural keyword density of 1-2%.
All optimizations should follow current search engine guidelines and best practices.
