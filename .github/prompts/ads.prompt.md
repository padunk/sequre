Create an HTML placeholder for Google AdSense advertisements that follows Google's display policies and technical requirements.
Include the standard ad container element with recommended dimensions (e.g., 728x90 for banner ads), proper responsive styling, and
placeholder comments for the official AdSense code.
The implementation should be optimized for desktop and mobile viewing, with clear boundaries to indicate the ad space during development.

Ensure the ad container:

- Uses semantic HTML5 markup
- Maintains responsive design principles
- Includes fallback content for when ads are blocked
- Follows Google AdSense's placement policies
- Contains proper class names for styling and tracking
- Implements loading behavior that won't impact page performance

Please note: You must have an approved Google AdSense account and replace the placeholder with your unique ad code from the AdSense dashboard.
