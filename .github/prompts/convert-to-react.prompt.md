Transform the existing application into a React Single Page Application (SPA) using Vite as the build tool and development environment. The migration should:

1. Set up a new Vite + React project structure while preserving existing business logic and functionality
2. Convert current views/pages into React components
3. Implement client-side routing using React Router
4. Migrate existing state management to React hooks
5. Set up proper asset handling for static files
6. Configure environment variables and build settings
7. Ensure API integrations are properly adapted for the React environment
8. Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
9. Set up necessary dev tools and debugging configurations
10. Document key architectural decisions and migration steps

Technical requirements:

- Use Vite v6.x or later
- React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests
- Follow React best practices and conventions
- Maintain existing performance benchmarks
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

Please provide the current application's tech stack and architecture to enable a more targeted migration strategy.
